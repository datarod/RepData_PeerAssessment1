# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r Load Data}
setwd("~/github/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
unzip(zipfile="activity.zip")
# All data and without NA's when required
activity<-read.csv("./activity.csv")
activityNna<-activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]
# 
#names(activity)
#head(activity,1)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r Histogram, Mean Median}
hist(activityNna$steps,main="steps per day",xlab="steps",col="blue")
mean(activity$steps,na.rm=T)
median(activity$steps,na.rm=T)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r Plot activity time series}
plot.ts(activity$interval,y=activity$steps)
max(activity$steps,na.rm=T)
```


## Imputing missing values
How bad is the missing problem
```{r missing values}
missing<-is.na(activity$steps)
table(missing)

```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
